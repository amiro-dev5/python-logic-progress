 Python Logic Progress

This project is a milestone in my Python learning journey. It demonstrates the core fundamentals of programming by integrating multiple concepts into a single functional engine.

  Concepts Covered:
- **Dynamic Variables:** Managing system states and user attempts.
- **For Loops:** Iterating through authorized user lists.
- **While Loops:** Maintaining continuous system operation until a condition is met.
- **Conditional Logic:** Implementing multi-level decision making (if-elif-else).

  How it Works:
The engine verifies authorized users and starts a logic hunt where the user must find a target value within limited attempts.
